# R code for project analyzing predictors of teenage pregnancy in Ecuador.

In Ecuador teenage pregnancy is an important social problem.  I am particularly interested in this issue because I am part of an NGO that works to guarantee teenage mothers' rights in Ecuador. Studies in different countries have found that education, knowledge of contraception, use of contraception, family history of teenage pregnancy, young first sexual experience, and rural residence are predictors of teenage pregnancy. I want to test which of these factors are predictors of teenage pregnancy in Ecuador. 

The population of interest are women between 10 and 24 years of age who are or have been pregnant. I will later expand my analysis in my senior project with information from the other ENSANUT databases.

There are 4 files with code.
  1. Extracting_Processing_Data --> This file has all the code for getting, reading, and manipulating the data.
  2. Statistics_Graphs.r --> This file has all the data exploration part with variable analysis and graphs.
  3. Analysis.r --> This file has the model, it's analysis, and the validation process.
  4. Project_3 --> This file has all the information of the three previous ones all in one.
